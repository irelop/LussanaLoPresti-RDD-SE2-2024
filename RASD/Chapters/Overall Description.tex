\subsection{Domain Class Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{Images/RASD-Domain Class Diagram.drawio.png}
    \caption{UML Domain Class Diagram}
\end{figure}
This Domain Class Diagram shows all the classes that will be created to manage the system and the relations between them. Only the relevant methods are present.
Here follows a more detailed explanation of the classes and the relations.\newline
The class \textbf{System} manages the users, creates the recommendations (represented by the class \textbf{Recommendation}), and handles the matches between students and internship positions. The abstract class \textbf{User} is created to generalise the two types of user that navigate through the system: Student and Company. \textbf{Student} is the class dedicated to university students, in particular, it has a list of \textbf{Competence}s, each one of them can be one of three types (\textbf{Skill}, \textbf{Attitude}, \textbf{Experience}) and has a description. The list called \textbf{interestedIntenshipFeatures} contains the fileds inserted in the search bar by the student, they are used by the System to create appropriate recommendations. \textbf{Company} handles the profile of a company, it is linked to the \textbf{InternshipAdv} class that manages the internship advertisements. This class contains all the relevant information that will be shown in the ADV, in particular it contains the field \textbf{candidateProfile} that will be used by the System to make consistent recommendation. It also includes the \textbf{InterviewForm} that contains all the information that has to be inserted in the form to be used during the interview for the advertised internship position. It can be inserted after a while from the creation of the ADV, so, for this reason, the cardinality is 0 to 1.\newline
The class \textbf{InternshipRequest} represent the request sent by the company (or the student) to the student (or the company) regarding a specific internship ADV. The boolean \textbf{isAccepted} will turn true if the counterpart accepts the propose. \newline
When a contact is made then a match between the student and the ADV is created. This is handeld by the class \textbf{Match} with the field \textbf{matchmakingStatus} that keeps track of the status of the match, it goes from the setting of the interview to the completion of the internship. It has a relation ("executes") with the class \textbf{Interview} that contains the information relevant for the interview between that specific Match. The class Match is also related to the class \textbf{Feedback}. A feedback can be created only in specific states of the match: after the interview is terminated ({INTERVIEW\_COMPLETED}), at the first half of the internship ({INTERNSHIP\_FIRST\_HALF}) and at the end ({INTERNSHIP\_COMPLETED}). Drafting the feedback is optional, and can be done in both directions: by the student for the company (S2C) and by the company for the student (C2S). This explains the cardinality 0 (it is optional) to 6 both the student and the company answer to all the feedback of the three states). 

\subsection{State Diagrams}

\section{Product functions}
\textbf{Sign up and Login}\newline
The S\&C platform allows users to register and log in depending on their role. Students can manage both the sign up and log in through their university credentials, i.e. the system redirects them to their university's website. A representative of a Company can register it by filling a form where they have to identify both the company and themselves. To identify the Company, they have to insert the VAT number and upload a certificate of registration at the Chamber of Commerce. To identify themselves, they have to insert their own company email and upload a letter of authorisation or official assignment signed by the CEO or an HR referent. The uploaded documentation will be reviewed by S\&C employees and if everything is correct, an email will be sent to the representative containing a username and a link to set a password.

\textbf{Update Student's profile}\newline
Students can update their profile in many ways: they can upload their CV (as a pdf) for the first time, but also upload a new version if they have updated it. They can also insert personal competences (such as skills, experiences, and attitudes) to be shown in their profile. Such competences can be modified and/or deleted whenever they want.

\textbf{Create internship's advertise}\newline
The platform allows representatives of Companies to create internship advertises where they can specify the project of the internship, the profile of the candidate they are looking for, and the terms offered. These advs can be modified or deleted from the platform.

\textbf{Proactive Research}\newline
The platform allows users to use a search bar. Students can find internships by inserting specific requirements about the project and/or the teams offered. If the system finds some suitable internships, it shows them to the Student who can click on them to visualise the adv and/on the Company's profile and eventually contact them. Companies' representatives can search for suitable candidates through this search bar by inserting the competences they are looking for. If the system finds Some suitable candidates, it shows them to the representative who can click on them to visualise the Student's profile and eventually contact them. 

\textbf{Recommendation}\newline
S\&C notifies users about potential matches. Proactive research criteria provided by students are used to recommend suitable internship opportunities. Similarly, the candidate profile specified in an internship advertisement is used to recommend matching students to companies. Recommendations are also based on the feedbacks received by the users. These recommendations are shared with the users and can be accessed via the Inbox section present in their profile. From the recommendation notifications, students can explore the internship advertisement and the company's profile, while companies can view the students' profiles.

\textbf{Matching between company and student and establishment of a contact}\newline
S\&C allows Student to contact Company that find on the platform through the research bar or thanks to the recommendation. S\&C also allows Company to contact Student that they found by the research bar or thanks to the recommendation. The system also will inform the Students and Companies if someone wants to contact them, the user contacted will see a message in the inbox section, and thorough that they will be able to get information about the user who contacted them. When receiving a message, the user can decide to reject the offer or to establish a contact.

\textbf{Selection process}\newline
S\&C allows Company, after they establish a contact with a student, to propose to the student some Date and Time slots in order to schedule an interview, the student will be pale to accept one of the proposals or reject them all. The system will provider assistance to Company during the interview too, indeed S\&C allows Company to create a standard form where they can write all the aspects that the interviewer will evaluate during the meeting.

\textbf{Feedback}\newline
S\&C allows Students to leave a feedback about the Company or some aspect of a Company during the selection period or about the internship that they are attending or have just finished. And allows Company to write feedback about a Student after the review, during the internship, or when the internship is just finished. The platform will use this feedback to enhance its recommendation system.

\textbf{Monitoring of the matchmaking process}\newline
S\&C allows every user to monitor their situation, in particular help to understand in which state of matchmaking or internship the users are. For Company S\&C allows to monitor the state of every student that is in contact with and with the ones who are attending an internship in the company, allowing us to leave a feedback to them. For Student allows to monitor the state of the matchmaking with the companies or the state of the internship that their are attending.

\section{User Characteristics}. Users who can interact with the system can be subdivided into two groups:
