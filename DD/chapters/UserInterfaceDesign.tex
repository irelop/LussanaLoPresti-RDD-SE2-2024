    \caption{User Interface Overview}
\end{figure}
This diagram shows how users can navigate the platform. Upon entering the website's URL, they are directed to the \textbf{Landing Page}, where they can choose between Registration and Login. Both pages allow users to switch to the other if needed. After logging in, users are redirected to their personalised \textbf{Home Page}, which varies depending on their role (S - Student, C - Company). A navigation bar is present on all pages, enabling users to move across the most relevant sections, i.e. \textbf{Profile Page}, \textbf{Monitor Page}, \textbf{Inbox Page}, and \textbf{Search Page}. The arrows in the diagram represent links between pages, but not all links are shown to maintain diagram clarity. Additionally, back buttons are available on each page to facilitate navigation.
When a student visits an \textbf{ADV Page}, they can send a request regarding that ADV (as shown by the arrow linking the Adv Page to the Request Page). Similarly, companies can perform the same action when viewing a studentâ€™s profile page.
Lastly, as discussed in the RASD document, users can provide feedback via the \textbf{Monitor Page}.
